# Bidding phase and host city selection
After Japan won the third contest, information surrounding potential venues was slowly gathered in order to help decide on an appropriate venue. Over the month of October, an official presentation of possible venues was developed, shortlisting 7 venues in 6 Japanese cities.

The cities Chiba, Fukuoka, Nagoya, Saitama, Sendai, and the capital Tokyo, were revealed as the official candidates for hosting the contest. Tokyo had two bids, the Nippon Budokan as well as the Tokyo Dome. Each city, and its venue, were assessed in a variety of capacities in order to determine which would be deemed as a viable host. Some of the criteria for assessment included:

- The size of the venue, ideally approximately 10,000 capacity
- In a relatively established city, that people know and are familiar with
