# Venue
Gliwice Arena is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Gliwice, Poland. It provides 13,752 seats in the stands (with room for up to 17,178 spectators) in the main arena and is considered one of the largest entertainment and sports halls in the country. It has also hosted the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2019.

# Bidding phase and host city selection
After Poland won the fourth contest, information regarding potential venues was slowly gathered in order to help decide on an appropriate venue. Over the months leading up to April, a list of possible venues was developed, shortlisting 7 venues in 6 Polish cities.

The cities Gdańsk, Gliwice, Katowice, Łódź, Toruń, and the capital Warsaw, were revealed as the official candidates for hosting the contest. Warsaw had two bids, the Stadion Narodowy and the Warsaw EXPO. Each city and its venue were assessed in a variety of capacities to determine which would be deemed a viable host. Some basis for assessment included:

- The size of the venue, ideally approximately 10,000 capacity
- In a relatively established city, that people know and are familiar with
- The difficulty in construction of a virtual venue`,g="Nedas' and Rob's Earthvision Song Contest 05 (2022)",y="earthvision",v="",m={edition:e,link:n,cancelled:!0,slogans:t,countries:i,venues:o,presenters:a,broadcasters:s,links:r,entries:d,shows:l,media:c,textContent:h,sfDraw:p,sfDrawText:u,bidding:w,biddingText:f,fullName:g,type:y,incidents:v};export{w as bidding,f as biddingText,s as broadcasters,k as cancelled,i as countries,m as default,e as edition,d as entries,g as fullName,v as incidents,n as link,r as links,c as media,a as presenters,p as sfDraw,u as sfDrawText,l as shows,t as slogans,h as textContent,y as type,o as venues};
